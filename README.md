# TF-and-Pytorch
Welcome to my repository of Tensorflow and pytorch frameworks! Explore a variety of models for tasks like image classification, transfer learning, linear regression, and logistic regression.

## Models Included

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Transfer Learning Models
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

## Usage

Clone this repository and use the models for your machine learning projects. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.

For example, run any model you want:

```bash
python 'change this to the model name'.'py or ipynb'
